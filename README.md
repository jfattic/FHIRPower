# PowerApps with Azure API for FHIR

#### This repository hosts the guidance and reference architecture for using PowerApps with Azure API for FHIR. These are only samples to get started and doesn't include all FHIR resources or functionality.

## Scenario

**Enhance physician efficiency**. The PowerApps application with FHIR for doctors is an indispensable tool when it comes to orchestrating massive patient datasets, optimizing communication, and making their job less stressful with minimum paperwork. It helps get more reliable results and insights faster that might be needed for further patient treatment.

**Improve patient experience**. The PowerApps application with FHIR for patients ensures all their medical data is secure, while enabling patients to access to their health data using user-friendly interface.

## Overview

### Azure API for FHIR
The healthcare industry is rapidly transforming health data to the emerging standard of FHIRÂ® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). FHIR enables a robust, extensible data model with standardized semantics and data exchange that enables all systems using FHIR to work together. FHIR also enables the rapid exchange of data in applications. Backed by a managed PaaS [Azure API for FHIR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/overview) offering, FHIR also provides a scalable and secure environment for the management and storage of Protected Health Information (PHI) data in the native FHIR format.

### Power Platform Connectors for Azure API for FHIR
A connector is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Platform. Connectors provide a way for users to leverage a set of pre-built actions and triggers to build applications and workflows.

The two Connectors that works with Azure API for FHIR contain a subset of FHIR Resources and are bi-directional supporting both reads and writes to the FHIR Service. 

**[FHIRBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirbase/)** and **[FHIRClinical](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirclinical/)** are certified custom connectors that allows for building secure healthcare applications to enable interoperability using FHIR.

## Prerequisites

### Azure API for FHIR
- Deploy Azure API for FHIR with First Party Auth by [deploying via the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir-paas-portal-quickstart). 
- To access the Azure API for FHIR, apply RBAC by adding users to `FHIR Data Reader` or `FHIR Data Contributor` role using Access Control (IAM). The users with access will authenticate through the Connector which assumes their role.
- Load sample data into Azure API for FHIR. Detailed instructions to load synthetic data can be found in [OpenHack-FHIR Github](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack-FHIR/tree/main/Challenge01-AzureAPIforFHIR#task-2-generate--load-synthetic-data)
- More details on using [Azure API for FHIR](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack-FHIR)

### Power Platform
- Get access to [Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/) environment to create Power Apps.
- Custom Connectors [FHIRBase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirbase/) and [FHIRClinical](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirclinical/) needs to be added to your PowerPlatform environment by your Admin.
- Details on [FHIRBase Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirbase/#actions) and [FHIRClinical Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/fhirclinical/#actions) for API calls.
- Mapping [FHIR Base and Clinical Resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) to FHIRBase and FHIRClinical connectors.
- More details on [Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/)

## Getting Started
This repository provides a starter kit by reading few fields from these **FHIR resources - Patient, Practitioner, Observation, Encounter, Appointment, Medication Request and Diagnostic Report (Lab Results)**.
It provdies the possibility to extend the App to include more fields and resources, write and update to Azure API for FHIR.

Let's get started on the steps to import sample Power App packages and run them in your Power Platform and Azure API for FHIR environments:

### Import sample PowerApps package
- Download the sample [packages](./packages).
- Open your [Power Apps Portal](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/).
- Click `Apps` on the left ribbon.
- Click `Import canvas app`.
- Click `Upload` and choose the sample .zip file you downloaded.
- Click `Update` in `IMPORT SETUP` and select `Create as new`, enter `Resource name` and click Save.
- Click `Import`.

### Edit or Run imported Apps
- You will get a message `All package resources were successfully imported`.
- Click `Apps` on the left ribbon to see the App you imported. **NOTE** there might be a few minutes delay.
- Select the imported App, and choose `Edit` to look at the code or make changes or `Play` to run the App.
- If you already have FHIRBase and FHIRClinical connectors added in `Prerequisites` above, you will get a popup - your App asking your permission to use the connectors, click `Allow`.
- Enter the `URL of FHIR Server` created in `Prerequistes` above. You can find it the `Azure API for FHIR service`, in `FHIR metadata endpoint' with the metadata suffix. Ex: `https://AzureAPIforFHIRName.azurehealthcareapis.com`
