# PowerApps with Azure API for FHIR

#### This repository hosts the guidance and reference architecture(s) for using PowerApps with Azure API for FHIR.

## Azure API for FHIR
The healthcare industry is rapidly transforming health data to the emerging standard of FHIRÂ® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). FHIR enables a robust, extensible data model with standardized semantics and data exchange that enables all systems using FHIR to work together. FHIR also enables the rapid exchange of data in applications. Backed by a managed PaaS offering in Azure, FHIR also provides a scalable and secure environment for the management and storage of Protected Health Information (PHI) data in the native FHIR format.
